        <h2>Forged by Flame</h2>
        <p>
          Kai’s bloodline runs deep—his father, Fillipi, a dragon of prophecy
          and power; his mother, Luna, descended from celestial beings. Yet
          Kai’s destiny was not to dominate, but to bridge worlds. Among
          dragons, he is both revered and questioned. His heart belongs not only
          to fire, but to humanity, and his bond with Zara—fierce, loyal, and
          radiant—grounds him as shadows rise.

        <h2>Bound by Honor</h2>
        <p>
          The Knights of the Eternal Flame, once sworn to slay dragons, found a
          brother in Kai. He saved their leader and earned their trust. Among
          them, he trained, fought, and laughed—especially with Finn, a bold
          warrior whose bond with Kai was forged in childhood. Together, they
          faced foes, won wars, and dreamed of peace, even as the threat of
          betrayal loomed ever closer.

        <h2>The Realm of Eldros</h2>
        <p>
          From the Ember Mountains where dragons roost, to the Citadel of Flame
          where knights rally, the lands of Eldros tremble beneath the march of
          Vaelthorn's army. Ancient shrines hold forgotten wisdom, and war drums
          echo across forest and stone. Kai must traverse this world—seeking
          lost relics, long-lost truths, and the strength to unite those who
          once stood apart.
